A tracker of interesting reading articles using Google docs as backend

It manages 2 tables with the following data:
1. url -> tags 
2. tag -> urls

Title | URL | Tags
--- | --- | --- 
Pagination in SQL | http://allyouneedisbackend.com/blog/2017/09/24/the-sql-i-love-part-1-scanning-large-table | pagination, sql 

Tags | URLs
--- | ---
pagination | http://allyouneedisbackend.com/blog/2017/09/24/the-sql-i-love-part-1-scanning-large-table

So we can save a URL with tags and then later query documents with tags.
